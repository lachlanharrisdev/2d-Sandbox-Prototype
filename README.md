# Overview
A small python project experimenting with cellular automata & eventually turning it into a game.

# Features
- Unique simulation for powders, fluids & gases on a cell-based grid
- Simulation for reactions, used to create unique particles
- Decay simulation where particles will turn into another over a period of time (used to make some realistic reactions like burning wood & evaporated water turning back into rain)
- Density simulation where particles will float above adjacent particles if they have a lower density, vice versa (works with gases too!)
- Currently 11 unique elements, each with their own density, colour, reactants, movement type, and more)
